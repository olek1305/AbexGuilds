# Abex Guilds
####  The Abyssal Expedition (Abex) is a cooperative event

## About

The project is only for the game AFK Arena.

You can manage not only one guild, but also multiple guilds,
add people to the list with injury records on abex from multiple seasons,
notebooks, transfers to another guild. Easy to use.

## TODO List

- Statistics page, which will check statistics such as number of dmg in different
  guilds, notes records, and other statistics
- page Logbook, checking if we have checked this player on this day, if yes, I mark like "complete"
- Light mode
- add language ENG

## Why did I do this project?

Some day I had a problem over control with people from around 400 to manage damage, records, notes, etc. I didn't want to create more channels on discord as a diary for people, without automatic is worse
